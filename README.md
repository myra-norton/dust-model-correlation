# dust model decorrelation
I worked on a research project from june 2021 to december 2021, and these are all of the notebooks I showed to my advisor.

Most of these notebooks were simply used to get a sense of how some of the basic physics looked and to get familiar with python, jupyter notebooks, pysm3, healpy, and matplotlib.

All of the good, juicy stuff that came out of this project is in the notebook "JP review.ipynb" (which also has some explanations of what I was doing)
